Crisis in Hogwarts ! The sorting hat is under a spell that leaves it dazed and he cannot plenish his functions anymore.  

The start of the school year is coming and Professor McGonagall has asked us to recreate the sorting hat thanks to our data scientist skills. Our algorithm should assign each student a Hogwarts House according to their features.

## Data visualisation

histogram.py plots a histogram of the grades of Hogwarts students according to their houses.  
scatter_plot.py highlights features that are similar.  
pair_plot.py plots a scatter plot matri for all numeric features.  

## Logistic Regression

logreg_train.py trains a logistic regression with response variable being Hogwarts House.  
logreg_predict.py predicts a Hogwarts House given a student and its features.
